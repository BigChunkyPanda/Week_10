## This is the heading for my ReadMe
I can do cool stuff like bolding text, **This is week 10's repo focused on markdown**
*I can choose to italicize sentences if I want*
I can even create lists:
1. we can use "** **" to bold sentences
2. We can use "* *" to italicize sentences
3. We can even add cute panda images. ![alt text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c58e1d72-42e1-4510-b332-75174fa09a16)
